#Capstone Product Plan
##Problem Statement <br/>
Currently, most of the daycare teachers are using pen and paper to update the parents with the daily info for each child, so in the end of day the parent gets a note that summaries that info (how much the child slept / eat/ wet diapers / and whether the parent should bring more diapers/ wipes/ changing cloths for school) <br>
The parent could easily lose the paper, forget it in the car, and not remember to bring diapers/wipes to school - since they not always read the whole thing.  <br>
•	Forgotten Baby Syndrome: Every year around 20 children have died from heat stroke in a car. <br>Currently daycares won’t contact the parents if the child hasn’t arrived to school, they’ll assume the child is sick <br>
##Market Research <br>
### non-app solution <br>
* Organized A4 paper with tables for food/ diapers and sleeping times. <br>

###Research <br>

* Using pen & paper has many cons <br>
    * the teacher not always has the time to write everything down
    * It can get lost <br>
    * If the teacher didn't add the date, it can be easily mixed up with former pages. <br>
    * Only one parent get the paper
* Differentiation <br>
    * It will be a faster and easier for the teacher to fill out the information<br>
    * Using my app, parents will recive an email in the end of each day with the details<br>
    * when they'll need to bring more diapers/wipes the app will send a reminder to their calendar<br>
    * Both of the parents will recive the email<br>

##User Personas <br>
### Daycare managers <br>
This is the marketing target group that will need to want to use this app in their DayCare <br>
    * They want to offer better communication for the parents.<br>
    * They are interested to increase the daycare income by have more parents signing in<br>
    * They are interested to keep their employees happy and satisfies. <br>
    * They need to take care of the children safety<br>
### Parents <br>
They won't be actually using the app (maybe in the future when it'll have more fitures), but they have strong intresets that this app will be easy and informativ with information about their children
   * They don't like the idea having a new paper note every day that summarize their child information. It get lost sometimes and when having more then one child, it can be left in the car.
   *  reminder to the calender using the email, when the parent need to bring more diapers/ wipes/ cloths
